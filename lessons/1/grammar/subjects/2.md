# First words

As we go through examples, I’ll make sure you have a small set of words so you can understand the examples properly. But before learning any word, let’s make the wording system clear.

Yenghi manages words as particle collages. Thus, these are not “words” in the usual sense, but glued-together ideas that create meaning. A single idea can carry several meanings, which is why using ideas alone can make the language difficult to understand. When using only the idea, we need to adjust it according to the *Kanakaï*. Knowing that each idea is built on meaningful roots is also very helpful.

> **Note:** There is a small difference between a *root* and an *idea*. Each root ends with the sound **-un**. If you need to use a root in a sentence, you must first turn it into an idea. To do this, you simply change the last sound to **-an**.
> For people who can read Arabic script: this is equivalent to changing **نٌ** to **نً**. Yenghi does not need to add the **ا** after a *fatḥa tanwīn*, because it uses a different reading system.

Also note that Yenghi does something extremely uncommon with some words: it takes a root from another language, changes its pronunciation, and places it in the *Nahaan Kanakaï*. This is what Yenghi calls **“Qardash köki”** (قردش كۆك), meaning “brother root”. This is extremely common in Yenghi, as the Legend of the Great Naame describes the creation of roots based on foreign roots.

## First roots

| Yenghi | reading       | meaning        | Kanakaï | origin                   |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| ھال    | "haal"        | state, feeling | Nahaan  | Arabic, حال              |
| ئىيى   | "iyi" (or iy) | good, well     | Turki   | Modern Turkish / Ottoman |
| ئەدگۈ  | "edgü"        | good, well     | Turki   | Old Turkic (Orkhon)      |
| ياھشى  | "yahshi"      | good, well     | Turki   | Eastern Turkic           |
| يق     | "Yaq" / "Yoq" | nothing, empty | Turkic  |                          |

> **Note:** In the greater Turkic world, Turkish speakers use **iyi**, while Eastern-Turkic speakers use **yahshi**, and the original form was **edgü**. Yenghi keeps all of them, and they all share the exact same meaning. Don’t forget to add **-un** at the end when using these as roots, and change it to **-an** when using it as ideas.

## Short sentences

ھڭ ھال سون ؟
[Hang haal son?]
(How are you?)

ئىيى من، ۋ سڭ ؟
[iyi mon, wä seng?]
(I’m good, and you?)

> **Notes:**
>
> * The word **ھڭ** (*hang*) is used to ask “which one (of them)”. When asking “How are you?”, you are effectively asking: “Which one (of all possible feelings) are you?”
> * To say “and”, we use the Arabic word **ۋ**, though the letter has been slightly modified to make it easier to read.
> * The default Kanakaï is **Turki**, even though the *Basqa* one can also be correct; when no specific word exists, we use Turki.
