# First words

As we'll go through examples, I'll make sure that you have a small set of words so you can understand examples properly. But before learning any word, let's make wording system clear.

Yenghi manages words as particle collages. Thus, it's not properly said words that we generally use, but glued ideas together in order to make sense. A single idea can hold itself different meanings, that's why using simply ideas can make the language really hard to understand. When using simply the idea, we need to accord it regarding the Kanakaï. Knowing that each ideas are built on meaning full roots is even more helpful.

> **Note:** There is a small difference between a root and an idea. Each roots ends by the sound "un". If you need to use a root in a sentence, you first have to translate it to an idea. To do so, you will just need to change the last sound to "an".
> For people who knows reading Arabic scripts, it's dropping نٌ to نً. Yenghi doesn't need to add the ا after a Fetha-Tanween, as it uses a different reading-system.

Also, know that Yenghi does something extremely uncommon with some words ; It takes a root from a language, changes its pronounciation, and puts it to the Nahaan Kanakaï. This is what Yenghi calls "Qardash köki" (قردش كۆك), meaning "brother root". This si something extremely common in Yenghi, as the Legend of The Great Naame used to create roots on top of stranger roots.

## First roots

| Yenghi | reading | meaning | Kanakaï | origin |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------ |
|  ھال   | "haal" | state, feeling | Nahaan | Arabic, حال |
|  ئىيى  | "iyi" (or iy) | good, well | Turki | Modern Turkish/Ottoman |
| ئەدگۈ | "edgü" | good, well | Turki | Old Turkic (Orkhon) |
| ياھشى  | "yahshi" | good, well | Turki | Eastern-Turkic |
| يق   | "Yaq" / "Yoq" | Nothing, empty | Turkic |

> **Note:** In the Great Turkic world, Turkish people uses "iyi" word, as Eastern-Turkic people uses "Yahshi", while the original one was "edgü". Yenghi prefered to keep all of them, and they all have the exact same meaning. Don't forget to add the "-un" at the end when using these words as roots. Change it to "-an" when using it as an idea.

## Short sentences

ھڭ ھال سون ؟
[Hang haal son?]
(How are you ?)

ئىيى من، ۋ سڭ ؟
[iyi mon, wä seng?]
(I'm good, what about you ?)

> **Note:**
> The word ھڭ (hang) is used to ask "which one [of them]". When asking someone' "how are you", we say him "Which one [of all possible feelings] are you
> To say "and", we use the Arabic word "ۋ".
> The default Kanakaï is Turki, even if Basqa one seems correct ; When we don't have words, we use Turki.
