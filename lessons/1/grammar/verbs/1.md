# Verbs

Language dances through words, but its movement comes from verbs. To bring our speech to life, we need verbs. And you’re lucky — verbs use the Kanakaïc system again. Don’t be scared — that’s exactly why Yenghi is written, to give easy access to origins. </br>

## Verb structure

Yenghi is aggressive and strict when it comes to Kanakaïing words. But a language full of rules and exceptions for everything isn’t really a language — it’s just a chaotic set of messy rules. Yenghi is even stricter when it comes to conjugation — you can’t just put things wherever you think they should go, otherwise your message becomes unclear. So Yenghi gives you a pattern. But don’t see this as something horrible or painful. It helps you, guides you, and shows you how to speak the language correctly.

With that said, you might understand a bit more how Yenghi works. Verbs aren’t the “verbs” you know. And yes, I named this chapter “verb” incorrectly — “verb” doesn’t mean much in Yenghi. Verbs, subjects, tense, possibility, and more all form a single word in Yenghi. Here is the structure:

What we call the “infinitive” form of a verb in English is called *Mastar* (مستر) in Yenghi.
Again, you’re lucky — Mastars are regular, meaning that whenever you see something ending in **-maq** (مق), it’s a mastar. And finding the root is even easier: you get it by removing **-maq**. That means that when importing a new verb from another language, you must create a Mastar. Sometimes there are rules for this, but we won’t go into them now.

Let’s take an example.

In Kanakaï Turki, we find the word **“yazì”** (يزىمق), which comes from the root **“y-z”** (يز), meaning the idea of leaving a print, a trace, a mark. **“yazì”** (يزى) means something that is written, a writing, while **“yìz”** (يىز) and **“ìz”** (ئىز) mean a print, a mark, a trace. From the root “yazì,” we can create a verb — simply add **-maq** at the end.

For the present tense, we use **-wati-** (ۋات) or **-yor-** (يور), which have the same meaning. With that, we can easily say “I am writing a writing” (even though this sounds strange in English…)

> يزى يزىۋاتمن (yazì yazìwatimen)

Why like this?
Yenghi uses the structure **[root–tense–possibility–subject]**.

> **Note:** When something is fully possible, we don’t specify it!
