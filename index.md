# **Yenghi-saan Language (Yenghi-saani)**

In a world that keeps changing, many parts of Turkic identity are slowly fading — especially the language.
This loss is not only political, but also cultural, ethnic, familial, and even spiritual. Language is what we use every day to express our feelings and to communicate. How can someone fully explain their culture or traditions if their language no longer allows them to?

This is **not** about rejecting the languages that helped shape our own. Of course, some languages, such as Russian, Chinese, French, or English, are not originally related to Turkic culture — and there is no reason to blame them for it. At the same time, we should not reject all the languages that currently contribute to our vocabulary. Some borrowed words have become essential, while others feel like burdens or political impositions.

I prefer a language where one can understand the root, the origin, and the “why.” Not a simple “because we say it like this,” but a meaningful “because of this.” A reason that shows us — and others — that Turkic is not barbaric or “strange,” but thoughtful, reflective, and alive.

Many people before me tried to create such a system. Unfortunately, they failed. There is the old legend of the *Naame* language, which is barely remembered today. There are no tutorials, no books, no dictionaries. The few traces left are in stories, dreams, and memories — almost like a myth.
This is why I (or he, or they) am writing this. Maybe it will not become a living language immediately, but perhaps one day it will, and I hope this with sincerity.

## **Introduction to the Language**

The name **Yenghi** (يەڭغى) comes from the Turkic word *Yeni*, meaning “new.” The “gh” sound is inspired by Arabic, since Yenghi uses several Arabic roots. The word “new” does not mean replacing other languages — rather, the language is designed to **preserve** these roots and bring them together into a new way of thinking in Turkic.

One of the most important principles of Yenghi is **roots**.
In Yenghi, we do not speak in “words” (as in English), but in modified root forms. Basing the language on roots instead of completed words allows ideas to be expressed more clearly and more deeply. Similar forms of “rootism” are already appearing in various slangs; making it a core part of Yenghi gives every word more meaning.
This is also why some Yenghi expressions might not be directly translatable into other languages.

## **Kanakaï (كاناكايى)**

This is the table used for conjugation in Yenghi. According to the Legend of the Great Naame, a similar system existed in the ancient language. Its name was close to **Kanakaï**, though its exact form is unknown. The term comes from *kana*, meaning “letter,” “fragment,” or “piece of meaning.” The ending *–kaï* means “distribution.” Thus, Kanakaï represents the grouping of roots, and knowing a root’s group tells you how to conjugate it.

The full set of Kanakaï is called **Kankaïlar** (not *Kanakaïlar*), because *–lar* is the Turkic plural suffix.

> **Note:** Because Mandarin Chinese historically interacted with Turkic peoples, Mandarin words may also be placed under **Yeqin**. The Yeqin category has more complex rules regarding origins.

## **Yenghi Writing System (Yenghi-Arabic)**

1. Yenghi uses **Uyghur-Arabic script** as the base.
2. **Letters represent both sound and semantic ideas**.

   * Each letter is tied to a concept or root family.
   * Example: The letter “ئ / a” might represent “creation, beginning, source.”
3. **Roots are written as letter sequences**, not just phonetic words.

   * Each root can generate multiple words through affixes or Kanakaï rules.
4. **Diacritics for pronunciation and meaning nuances**

   * Small marks indicate tense, plurality, or Kanakaï category.

5. **Letters carry both sound and meaning**.
6. **Roots are the atomic unit**, combined with diacritics and affixes.
7. **Kanakaï categories** can be shown visually if desired.
8. **Right-to-left**, similar to Arabic, but reading rules differ.
