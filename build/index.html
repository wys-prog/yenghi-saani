<h1 id="yenghi-saan-language-yenghi-saani"><strong>Yenghi-saan Language
(Yenghi-saani)</strong></h1>
<p>In a world that keeps changing, many parts of Turkic identity are
slowly fading — especially the language. This loss is not only
political, but also cultural, ethnic, familial, and even spiritual.
Language is what we use every day to express our feelings and to
communicate. How can someone fully explain their culture or traditions
if their language no longer allows them to?</p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> about rejecting the languages that
helped shape our own. Of course, some languages, such as Russian,
Chinese, French, or English, are not originally related to Turkic
culture — and there is no reason to blame them for it. At the same time,
we should not reject all the languages that currently contribute to our
vocabulary. Some borrowed words have become essential, while others feel
like burdens or political impositions.</p>
<p>I prefer a language where one can understand the root, the origin,
and the “why.” Not a simple “because we say it like this,” but a
meaningful “because of this.” A reason that shows us — and others — that
Turkic is not barbaric or “strange,” but thoughtful, reflective, and
alive.</p>
<p>Many people before me tried to create such a system. Unfortunately,
they failed. There is the old legend of the <em>Naame</em> language,
which is barely remembered today. There are no tutorials, no books, no
dictionaries. The few traces left are in stories, dreams, and memories —
almost like a myth. This is why I (or he, or they) am writing this.
Maybe it will not become a living language immediately, but perhaps one
day it will, and I hope this with sincerity.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="introduction-to-the-language"><strong>Introduction to the
Language</strong></h2>
<p>The name <strong>Yenghi</strong> (يەڭغى) comes from the Turkic word
<em>Yeni</em>, meaning “new.” The “gh” sound is inspired by Arabic,
since Yenghi uses several Arabic roots. The word “new” does not mean
replacing other languages — rather, the language is designed to
<strong>preserve</strong> these roots and bring them together into a new
way of thinking in Turkic.</p>
<p>One of the most important principles of Yenghi is
<strong>roots</strong>. In Yenghi, we do not speak in “words” (as in
English), but in modified root forms. Basing the language on roots
instead of completed words allows ideas to be expressed more clearly and
more deeply. Similar forms of “rootism” are already appearing in various
slangs; making it a core part of Yenghi gives every word more meaning.
This is also why some Yenghi expressions might not be directly
translatable into other languages.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="kanakaï-كاناكايى"><strong>Kanakaï (كاناكايى)</strong></h2>
<p>This is the table used for conjugation in Yenghi. According to the
Legend of the Great Naame, a similar system existed in the ancient
language. Its name was close to <strong>Kanakaï</strong>, though its
exact form is unknown. The term comes from <em>kana</em>, meaning
“letter,” “fragment,” or “piece of meaning.” The ending <em>–kaï</em>
means “distribution.” Thus, Kanakaï represents the grouping of roots,
and knowing a root’s group tells you how to conjugate it.</p>
<p>The full set of Kanakaï is called <strong>Kankaïlar</strong> (not
<em>Kanakaïlar</em>), because <em>–lar</em> is the Turkic plural
suffix.</p>

System (Yenghi-Arabic)</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Yenghi uses <strong>Uyghur-Arabic script</strong> as the
base.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Letters represent both sound and semantic
ideas</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each letter is tied to a concept or root family.</li>
<li>Example: The letter “ئ / a” might represent “creation, beginning,

<li><p><strong>Roots are written as letter sequences</strong>, not just
phonetic words.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each root can generate multiple words through affixes or Kanakaï
rules.</li>

<li><p><strong>Diacritics for pronunciation and meaning

<li><p><strong>Letters carry both sound and meaning</strong>.</p></li>
